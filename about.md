Hello ! I am Divesh Soni from India. My early childhood was spent around lovely palaces and lakes in Rajasthan. I was fascinated by everything in the sky, from stars and airplanes to sparrows and dragonflies. I used to experiment on paper airplanes to get them to land the farthest. I dreamt of flying in the blue skies with jetpacks and feeling the wind on my face.
